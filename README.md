# SentinelX: Multi-Channel Financial Fraud Detection System

## 1. Project Overview

**SentinelX** is an end-to-end, portfolio-grade **financial fraud detection system** built using machine learning on real-world style transaction data.

The project uses the Kaggle dataset **“Financial Transactions Dataset for Fraud Detection”**, which contains around **5 million transactions** across multiple channels such as **mobile, web, ATM, and POS**. The goal is to simulate how a modern bank or fintech company detects fraudulent behavior in real time.

This project is designed using the **PACE framework**:

- **P – Problem**: Clearly define the real-world fraud detection problem.
- **A – Approach**: Design ML + data strategy tailored to multi-channel financial systems.
- **C – Components**: Build the full pipeline (data → features → models → API → dashboard → monitoring).
- **E – Evaluation**: Use fraud-aware metrics and business impact measures.

## 2. Business Problem

Banks and fintech companies process millions of transactions daily across **multiple digital channels** (ATM, POS, mobile apps, online banking). Among these, only a very small fraction is fraudulent, but:

- **Missing a fraud** (false negative) can cause direct financial loss and regulatory issues.  
- **Flagging a genuine customer as fraud** (false positive) hurts customer trust and experience.  
- Fraudsters often **switch devices, channels, and patterns** to avoid detection.

**Core business challenge:**  
> How can we build a system that **detects fraudulent transactions early and accurately** across channels, **without** generating too many false alerts for genuine customers?

## 3. Project Objectives

This project aims to:

1. Build a **machine learning–based fraud detection model** for multi-channel transactions.
2. Apply **behavioral and temporal feature engineering** (e.g., transaction velocity, device switching, channel usage patterns).
3. Handle **highly imbalanced data** using appropriate techniques (class weights, sampling, anomaly detection).
4. Expose the model through a **fast inference API** (e.g., FastAPI).
5. Create a **fraud monitoring dashboard** to visualize:
   - high-risk transactions  
   - customer histories  
   - channel-wise fraud patterns  
6. Evaluate the system using **fraud-focused metrics**:
   - Precision–Recall AUC  
   - Fraud Recall (recall on fraudulent class)  
   - Balanced Accuracy, MCC  
   - Cost-based evaluation of false positives vs false negatives.

## 4. Dataset Description

**Source:** Kaggle – [Financial Transactions Dataset for Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryan208/financial-transactions-dataset-for-fraud-detection)

**Key properties:**

- ~5,000,000 transaction records.
- Multiple transaction **channels**: mobile, web, ATM, POS, etc.
- Includes a binary **fraud label** indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent.
- Contains various features that allow:
  - user behavior profiling  
  - device and channel analysis  
  - time-based patterns.

> **Note:** The raw dataset is not committed to this repository (due to size and licensing).  
> Please download it directly from Kaggle and place it under the `data/` folder.

## 5. PACE Framework for This Project

### 🅟 – Problem

- Detect fraudulent transactions across **multi-channel financial systems**.
- Focus on rare-event detection, behavior deviation, device-switching, and attack patterns.
- Business goal: **reduce fraud loss** while **minimizing false alerts** on genuine customers.

### 🅐 – Approach

- Use **supervised learning** (e.g., XGBoost/LightGBM) combined with **anomaly detection** (e.g., autoencoders) where appropriate.
- Apply **behavioral and temporal feature engineering**:
  - transaction velocity per user/device/channel  
  - time-of-day and day-of-week features  
  - device and merchant risk scores.
- Use **imbalanced learning** strategies (sampling, class weights, threshold tuning).
- Add **explainability** using SHAP for model transparency.

### 🅒 – Components

Planned components:

- Data ingestion & preprocessing module.
- Feature engineering & **Fraud Feature Store**.
- Model training & evaluation scripts.
- Real-time inference API using **FastAPI**.
- **Streamlit** dashboard for fraud monitoring and analysis.
- Model monitoring & drift detection utilities.

### 🅔 – Evaluation

The model will be evaluated using:

- **Precision–Recall AUC**
- **Fraud Recall (TPR for fraud class)**
- **Balanced Accuracy**
- **MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient)**
- Cost-based metrics (penalty for missing fraud vs blocking genuine users).

## 6. Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Language**: Python  
- **Data & ML**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM, imbalanced-learn  
- **Explainability**: SHAP  
- **API**: FastAPI  
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit (plus optional Power BI/Tableau views)  
- **Experiment tracking** (optional): MLflow or simple logging  
- **Version control**: Git & GitHub

---

## 7. Ethical & Practical Considerations

- This is a **synthetic/simulated dataset**, but it represents realistic financial behavior.
- No real customer-identifiable information is used.
- In real-world systems, fraud detection models must consider:
  - fairness and bias  
  - privacy and data protection laws (e.g., GDPR)  
  - clear explanations for blocked transactions and alerts.
